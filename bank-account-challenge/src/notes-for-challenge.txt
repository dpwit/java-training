For this Java challenge, I'll create a problem that's engaging and suitable for someone who has just finished the beginner course. The goal is to complete it within 2 hours.

Challenge: "Banking System"

You are tasked with creating a simple banking system that allows users to perform basic transactions. The system should have the following features:

1. User Registration: Users can register with their name and account number.
2. Deposit: Users can deposit money into their accounts.
3. Withdrawal: Users can withdraw money from their accounts (up to a maximum limit).
4. Balance Inquiry: Users can check their current balance.

Requirements:
1. Create a BankAccount class with the following methods:

i. register(String name, int accountNumber): registers a new user with the given name and account number.
ii. deposit(int amount): adds the given amount to the user's account balance.
iii. withdraw(int amount): subtracts the given amount from the user's account balance (up to a maximum limit).
iv. getBalance(): returns the current account balance.

2. Create a Main class that contains the main method, which allows users to interact with the banking system.

Constraints:

1. Use only basic Java concepts learned in the beginner course (e.g., variables, data types, control structures, methods).
2. No external libraries or frameworks are allowed.
3. The program should be able to handle a maximum of 5 users (you can hardcode these).

Tips and Hints:

1. Use object-oriented programming principles to design the BankAccount class.
2. Implement validation for deposit and withdrawal amounts to prevent negative balances.
3. Consider using an array or list to store user information.

Judging Criteria:
1. Correct implementation of the required methods in the BankAccount class.
2. Proper handling of user registration, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
3. Code organization, readability, and commenting ( bonus points for good comments!).
